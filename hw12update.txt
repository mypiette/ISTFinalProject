# Project Name: Help me choose!

As you may recall, my project was inspired by a group of friends and I not being 
able to decide where to go for dinner one night. We had a lot of options but because 
we were so hungry, we simply could not choose. What we needed was someone or someTHING 
to help us make a decision. And thus, this project was born.

My overall goal is to try to use as much, if not all, of the functions that are offered 
by the Random python module to make a library of decision helper functions. The library 
would include simple functions such as random.choice to more complex such as random.shuffle 
or a variation of coin flips for various choices. I am planning on leveraging some common 
decision functions, such as rock, paper, scissors, and pick a number, as well as more complex 
ones such as using several layers of rock, paper, scissors, lizard,spock to narrow down answers.

As of right now, I have a couple of the functions for choosing between two answers. I decided 
to differentiate between number of choices simply to make the user feel that they can have the 
best possibilities for their decision making process based on number of choices as well as to make 
each answer more focused. So the user can choose between having 2 choices, 3 choices, or more than 
3 choices, in which they will be making a whole new array. 

The attached page of screenshots of both the 2choices - Random function and the 
2choices - Rock, Paper, Scissors functions. They're currently handled in the terminal for ease of 
use, though I did try to make them more readable/user friendly.
